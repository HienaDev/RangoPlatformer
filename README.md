## Story Lore:

 Rango was a dreamer and longed for adventure beyond the confines of his glass tank. One day, while traveling with his owners, their car hit a bump, and Rango found himself stranded in the middle of the desert.

Lost and alone, Rango stumbled upon the town of Dirt, a drought-ridden outpost inhabited by various desert creatures. The townsfolk were desperate for water, and their hope seemed to lie in the legendary Spirit of the West. Impersonating a tough and fearless gunslinger, Rango concocted an elaborate backstory to impress the townspeople, claiming to be a legendary hero.

Rango's tales quickly won the admiration of the townsfolk, including the eccentric but wise Mayor Tortoise John. He appointed Rango as the new sheriff, giving him the responsibility to protect the town from the menace of the ruthless hawk, Red.

As Rango settled into his new role, he soon realized that things were not as they seemed in Dirt. The town's water supply was controlled by a greedy businessman named Tortoise Jake, who was intentionally keeping the town dry to maintain his power. 

In his quest for the truth, Rango made a friend, a resilient female lizard named Beans, who had her own suspicions about Tortoise Jake's actions. Together, they embarked on a dangerous journey to find the real source of water in the desert. Along the way, they encountered a gang of bank-robbing moles, an eccentric armadillo named Roadkill, and a wise old snake named Priscilla.

As Rango dug deeper, he discovered a secret underground reservoir that Tortoise Jake was using to hoard water. Realizing the extent of Tortoise Jake's deception, Rango rallied the townsfolk and exposed the truth. A fierce battle ensued between Rango and Red, the hawk.

Using his wits and quick reflexes, Rango outsmarted the Hawk and saved the town from its tyranny. However, his journey wasn't over yet. In his pursuit of the truth, Rango encountered a formidable enemy in the form of Rattlesnake Jake, a ruthless and cunning snake.

Rattlesnake Jake was an enforcer for Tortoise Jake, and he didn't take kindly to Rango's meddling in their affairs. The two engaged in a fierce showdown, with Rattlesnake Jake using his venomous fangs and coiled strikes to overpower Rango. But Rango, clever and resourceful as ever, used his agility and camouflage skills to dodge the snake's attacks and strike back.

With a venomous hiss, Rattlesnake Jake confronted Rango, seeing through the chameleon's façade. He taunted Rango, accusing him of being nothing more than a fraud and a charlatan, pretending to be a hero while hiding from his true self.

The townsfolk, shocked and bewildered, looked on as Rattlesnake Jake revealed the truth. Rango, feeling the weight of his deception, initially faltered under the snake's accusations. Doubt and guilt washed over him, threatening to engulf his spirit.

In a thrilling battle, Rango managed to outmaneuver Rattlesnake Jake, using his chameleon abilities to blend into his surroundings and deliver a decisive blow. With Rattlesnake Jake defeated, Rango emerged victorious, earning the respect of the townsfolk and cementing his place as a true hero.

Rango's journey taught him the importance of being true to oneself and standing up for what is right, even in the face of adversity. He embraced his identity as a chameleon and found the courage to lead the town of Dirt toward a brighter future.

With his mission accomplished, Rango bid farewell to Dirt and set off on new adventures, forever changed by his time in the desert town. The legend of Rango, the heroic chameleon, would live on in the hearts of the townsfolk, reminding them that even the unlikeliest heroes can make a difference.

And so, Rango ventured into the vast desert, ready to embrace whatever challenges lay ahead, armed with the knowledge that true courage comes from within.

* After that the player will find the cactus juice item that will speed up the player's velocity and cancel the slow-down time the sun gives to the movement of the player.

* The puzzles will get harder and will require the player to use these power-ups in a certain order, or with a bit of freedom.
