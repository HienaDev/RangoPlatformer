# OKAPI KIT

![TitleImage](Screenshots/title.png)

This is a series of premade scripts intended for kit bashing of quick game development experiments for the  [Licenciatura em Videojogos][lv] da [Universidade Lus√≥fona de Humanidades e Tecnologias][ULHT] in Lisbon.

It's currently still under development, and eventually will be commented properly, and have a manual.

# Samples

It currently has six sample 'games' (each a Scene under the Samples directory), accessible through a menu (Samples scene, also in the Samples directory).

## Pong

# Documentation

For now, there's no documentation yet, but everything has custom editors, which display information on what each thing is doing (dynamically, depending on options selected):

![InspectorImage](Screenshots/inspector.png)

In this image, we can see a bit of the inspector of a normal object (the player object in the asteroids sample). There's the normal Unity components (Sprite Renderer, Rigidbody, Collider), and then we have 
several Okapi Kit components (identifiable by the large title). We have a movement script (rotation movement), an hypertag (allows to define what this object is, usefull to identify objects in collisions or
as targets for operations), we have a collision Trigger (with the text that explains when it triggers,
and what happens), and finally we have several Action scripts (used by the Triggers), that also explain what they're doing.
